# Buttle Royal
Simplistic, goofy, upside-down Fighter

Two butts face off against each other. One player on the ground the other one upside-down. You punch the enemy to stack up damage. More damage means more knockback therefore making it easier to throw your opponent offstage. The first one with four kills wins.
