# Buttle Royal
Simplistic, goofy, upside-down Fighter

Two butts face off against each other. One player on the ground the other one upside-down. You punch the enemy to stack up damage. More damage means more knockback therefore making it easier to throw your opponent offstage. The first one with four kills wins.

Attention:
There are some minor things that might be in the way of a showcase
* resolution is only optimized for 1920x1080 (menu is fine but screen might be cut off in-game)
* no quit-button (you have to ALT + F4 out)
* only debug build working properly because there´s no accumulator in the PhysicsManager
* there are other gameplay related issues, that I would like to fix
